  "summary": "REQ-16 and REQ-17 appear implemented: Gallery has a clearly labeled \"Usable only\" toggle that filters `record.usable === true` without reload and persists state via the `usableOnly` query param; Creation Detail reads the same query param to resolve the record index against the filtered+sorted list and preserves the filter state when navigating back to Gallery. One potentially unrequested informational Alert was added to Creation Detail.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest scope is limited to adding a usability filter control and URL-persisted navigation consistency; this new informational content is not requested and is unrelated to the filter behavior.",
